I need json data that represents different threads in a forum. The data should contain the fields 'title', 'threadId', 'creator'. create me 3 elements

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, now I need posts for every thread. every post should contain the fields 'username', 'content', 'date' and 'threadId'.
date contains the the date the post was posted, as seconds since 1970. threadId should contain a reference to one of the three threads you just created.
Create 5-15 posts for every thread, formatted in json as a list of objects.
