I am developping an online forum using react, typescript and tailwind and I'd like you to help me with that by writing code for me.

When writing code, don't leave anything out. When correcting or expanding code of a previous answers, write the whole file again and not just the changed or added part.

Don't write any comments in the code and don't explain the code afterwards or before. The answer should contain only code and no spoken language.

The code that you provide me should be complete so that I can copy paste it into my project without modifying it.
